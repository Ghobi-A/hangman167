# Prerequsiites

Before doing the hangman task, there was some milestones and subtasks that had to be done. This included the following:
 
Creating a word bank with fruits and making the user input a letter of the randomly selected fruit. If the letter corresponds with any of the letters in the word, the user is given a print statement saying that the letter is correct. 


# Hangman
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters one at a time. This implementation of Hangman is a Python console-based game where the computer selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has a limited number of lives to guess the word.

# How to Play
Run the Hangman game by executing the Python script that contains the code (e.g., python hangman.py).

You will be presented with a randomly selected word from the word list, and the game will start with a set number of lives (default: 5).

Guess a letter by entering it into the console when prompted. Letters should be in lowercase.

The game will inform you whether your guess is correct or not. If correct, the letter will be revealed in the word. If incorrect, you'll lose a life.

Continue guessing letters until you either guess the entire word or run out of lives.

If you guess the word correctly, you win the game and the word is revealed. If you run out of lives, you lose, and the word is also revealed.

The game will end, and you can choose to play again or exit.
