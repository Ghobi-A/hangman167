# Prerequsiites

Before doing the hangman task, there was some milestones and subtasks that had to be done. This included the following:
 
Creating a word bank with fruits and making the user input a letter of the randomly selected fruit. If the letter corresponds with any of the letters in the word, the user is given a print statement saying that the letter is correct. 


# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.
